Educational Robot Platform for Programming Learning

Whether you're teaching a programming class or experimenting with robotics, this platform is a robust and flexible tool for learning and exploration.


### Sensors
- **8 Line Sensors**: For line-following activities and navigation.
- **Side Obstacle Sensors**: Ideal for maze-solving and obstacle detection.
- **Front Distance Sensor (Sonar)**: Measures distances to objects in front of the robot.
- **Gyroscope and Accelerometer**: Enables orientation and motion tracking.
- **Analog Temperature Sensor**: Measures ambient temperature.
- **Analog Light Sensor**: Detects surrounding light intensity.


### Interface and Outputs
- **16x2 LCD Display**: Equipped with an I2C interface for easy data display and interaction.
- **3 Programmable LEDs**: Each individually controllable.
- **3 Buttons**: Each connected to its own microcontroller port.
- **2 Independent White LEDs**: Serve as car-like headlights.
- **4 WS2812 LEDs**: Located at the edges of the robot, functioning as customizable indicators or turn signals.
- **3 Servo Motor Outputs**: Provides flexibility for additional mechanical functionality.
- **Arduino Uno-Compatible Headers**: Allows integration of shields and expansion of functionality.

### Mobility
The robot features two side-mounted wheels, enabling tank-style differential steering for precise movement control.

## Educational Focus
This platform is designed to help students develop essential programming skills by working on practical robotics projects. It provides opportunities to:
- Learn about sensor integration and data processing.
- Program movement algorithms for obstacle avoidance, line following, and maze navigation.
- Utilize visual and auditory feedback for enhanced interactivity.

## Compatibility
The robot is fully compatible with the Arduino IDE and supports a wide range of Arduino libraries. This ensures ease of use and accessibility for beginners and advanced users alike.
